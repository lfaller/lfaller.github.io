**Interviewing Is Networking in Disguise**

Think "networking" means awkward small talk at crowded bars? Same.

But here's what changed my perspective: every interview is actually a 30-minute networking conversation with someone in your field.

Whether you get the job or not, you just spent meaningful time with:

- Someone who understands your expertise
- A potential future colleague or collaborator  
- A connection who might think of you for other opportunities

## The move most people miss

After each interview, send a LinkedIn connection request with a quick personalized note. Something simple like:

"Thanks for the conversation about [specific topic you discussed]. Really enjoyed learning about your approach to [relevant detail]."

They'll remember you. You'll stay on their radar. And you've just turned a job interview into a genuine professional relationship.

Even if this role doesn't work out, that connection might lead to your next opportunity—or you might help each other down the road.

How do you approach networking during the interview process?
