This is an example markdown file showing how to format your content for cross-posting.

## Key Features

You can use **bold text** to emphasize important points, and the script will convert it to Unicode bold for LinkedIn.

Here are some important insights:
- Data science is evolving rapidly
- **Machine learning** models require careful validation
- Always document your methodology

You can include [links like this](https://example.com) and they'll be properly formatted for each platform.

<!-- #MachineLearning #DataEngineering #AI -->

This content will be automatically converted to the right format for LinkedIn (plain text with Unicode bold and hashtags) and Jekyll (clean markdown without HTML comments).
