## Final Test - Image Copying with Fixed Path Resolution

This is the final test to verify that:
1. Images are correctly located on disk
2. Paths are properly resolved in the workflow context
3. Images are copied to `public/blog_images/`
4. Image paths are updated in the frontmatter
5. All files are committed and pushed in the PR

### Expected Outcome

PR should contain:
- ✓ Post file with `/blog_images/2025-07-15-the-bioinformatics-triangle.png` path
- ✓ Image file at `public/blog_images/2025-07-15-the-bioinformatics-triangle.png`
- ✓ Complete, ready-to-merge PR

Let's make sure this works!
