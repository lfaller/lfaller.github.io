This is an example markdown file showing how to format your content for cross-posting.
You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and even `code snippets` in your markdown.
Here are some important insights:
- Data science is evolving rapidly
- Machine learning models require careful validation
- Always document your methodology
You can include [links like this](https://example.com) and they'll be properly formatted for each platform.
This content will be automatically converted to the right format for LinkedIn (plain text with hashtags) and Jekyll (clean markdown without hashtags).
