There's a critical tipping point every biotech company hits: your computational team can't keep up with the data your scientists produce.

Suddenly, the very team meant to accelerate discovery becomes the bottleneck. Scientists are waiting days for reports while breakthrough insights sit locked in databases.

This is when smart organizations invest in empowering their wetlab scientists with self-service tools. Why? Because science moves at breakneck speed, and handcrafted reports simply can't scale.

But here's the nuance most companies miss: timing matters.

Early in discovery, when you're still prototyping analyses and figuring out what's important, custom reports are essential. You can't standardize what you haven't defined yet.

The magic happens when you graduate from "What should we measure?" to "How do we measure this consistently?" That's your cue to build tools that let scientists explore their own data.

I've seen teams reduce analysis turnaround from days to minutes by giving scientists intuitive dashboards (personally, I am a big fan of streamlit ðŸ¤“ but I am not going to say no to shiny). The computational team shifts from being report factories to building platforms that amplify scientific productivity.

The goal isn't to replace computational expertiseâ€”it's to democratize access so brilliant scientists can spend their time doing what they do best: making discoveries.

What's your experience with this tipping point? Have you seen teams successfully navigate this transition?
