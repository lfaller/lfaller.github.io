# Work With Me

## Remove Data Bottlenecks in Your Biotech

I help biotech companies remove data bottlenecks by building self-service tools that get scientists to actionable insights in minutes instead of days, without relying on overworked data scientists.

### The Problem I Solve

Your scientists are brilliant, but they're stuck waiting days or weeks for data analysis. Your data team is overwhelmed with ad-hoc requests, and critical decisions are delayed while insights sit locked in databases.

### What I Offer

I build intuitive self-service platforms that empower your scientists to:
- Access and explore complex datasets independently
- Generate insights without writing code
- Make faster, data-driven decisions
- Free up your data science team to focus on strategic work

### My Approach

With 10+ years of experience at the intersection of software engineering and life sciences, I specialize in:
- **Data democratization:** Creating tools that make complex genomic and multi-omics data accessible to non-technical scientists
- **Scalable architecture:** Building cloud-based data pipelines that grow with your needs
- **User-centered design:** Developing interfaces that scientists actually want to use
- **Cross-functional collaboration:** Bridging the gap between computational and biological teams

### Results

When scientists have frictionless access to their data, breakthroughs happen faster. I transform manual, bottlenecked processes into automated, self-service solutions that accelerate scientific discovery.
