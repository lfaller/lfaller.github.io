    <p>Sometimes the best features come from a single sentence in a meeting.</p>

<p>I was sitting with our wetlab director when she mentioned, almost in passing: “I wish we could see how our controls have performed historically…”</p>

<p>My brain lit up. “Wait—you want this data? I HAVE this data!”</p>

<p>Because we’d built our data warehouse to be comprehensive from day one, this “wish” became reality in under a week. One new tab in our visualization app, and suddenly scientists could track control performance trends across months of experiments.</p>

<p>Here’s what made this magic possible:</p>

<p>➡️ Strategic infrastructure pays dividends: We didn’t just build for today’s requirements—we captured everything we could think of, knowing future questions would emerge. That upfront investment in comprehensive data modeling meant we could pivot to new insights instantly.</p>

<p>➡️ Low effort, high impact: The technical lift was minimal because the foundation was solid. No emergency data migrations, no rushed ETL pipelines. Just a new query and some charts.</p>

<p>➡️ Collaboration creates breakthroughs: Here’s my favorite part: I never thought to surface this data on my own. It took a scientist’s domain expertise to recognize the value hidden in our warehouse.</p>

<p>This is how great science happens—when technical infrastructure meets scientific curiosity. The data was always there, but it took cross-functional conversation to unlock its potential.</p>

<p>The lesson? Build your data foundation wide and deep. You never know which “I wish we could see…” will become your next game-changing feature.</p>

<p>And always, ALWAYS listen for those casual comments in meetings. They’re often treasure maps to your next big win.</p>

<p>What unexpected insights have emerged from your data infrastructure? What “casual wishes” turned into powerful features?</p>
