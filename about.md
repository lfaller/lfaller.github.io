# Hi, I'm Lina!

![Lina L Faller](/assets/images/headshot.jpg){:width="200px" style="border-radius: 50%; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px auto;"}

I'm a technology leader with 10+ years of experience building scalable data systems at the intersection of software engineering and life sciences. I'm passionate about democratizing data access, creating tools that empower non-technical scientists to independently explore and interpret complex biological data. As a "bridge builder" between computational and biological domains, I've consistently transformed manual processes into automated, scalable solutions that accelerate scientific discovery. My expertise spans from architecting cloud-based data pipelines to leading cross-functional teams, always with a focus on making complex genomic and multi-omics datasets accessible to the scientists who need them most. I believe that the best scientific breakthroughs happen when brilliant researchers have frictionless access to their data.
